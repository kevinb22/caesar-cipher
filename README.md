# caesar-cipher
- Basic app to make while exploring with xcode. Built using Swift. 
- Encrypts and decrypts a (solely alphbetic) message using the caesar cipher.
- Originally the plan was to have a much larger project with more ciphers but decided to move
  that to a further date and use frameworks such as Cordova/Ionic. This is the
  extent of this project.

TODOs
-------------------
- Fit and finish
  - Have some sort of view panel to display the encrypted/decrypted message.
  - Fix action for setting the message and shift values currently based on 
  whether or not the enter key was hit, should be when the label is no longer
  edited.
  - Figure out whether or not the labels should be cleared (if a shift or the 
  message it change or something other).
  - Maybe change the color scheme so the app doesn't look terribly generic.
- Edit the scheme for the swift tests.
