# caesar-cipher
- Basic app to make while exploring with xcode. Built using Swift. 
- Encrypts and decrypts a (solely alphbetic) message using the caesar cipher.
- Originally the plan was to have a much larger project with more ciphers but decided to move
  that to a further date and use frameworks such as Cordova/Ionic with
  javascript. This is the extent of this project.

TODOs
-------------------
- Fit and finish
  - Maybe change the color scheme so the app doesn't look terribly generic.
