# caesar-cipher
- Basic app to make while playing around with xcode. Build using swift and javascript and probably some other languages.
- Encrypts and decrypts a (solely alphbetic) message using the caesar cipher.

TODOs
-------------------
- Hook up the JS code to the app and actually design and implement the app and stuff.
- Expand the app to more than just caesar cipher, probably include polyalphabetic cipher, and the one-time pad. Maybe RSA encryption as well.
